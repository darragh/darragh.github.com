consider adding copilot too as further layer...

https://intercom.slack.com/archives/C04R8EEP9GX/p1715613222469449 suggests CS cost is $2 / hour in Brazil...
    - how many conversations do the reps do per hour?
    - should we discount in scrappy way here? at volume...
    2 * hour = 320 / month.... seat price... 360...

add seat price reduction to ROI calculator

get dump of existing customers with some context/stats on historic seat usage and volume and growth/trajectory

add copilot
build in YoY growth view... both for model improvements and volume growth...

how to cater for spikes - e.g. gymshark...

Gymshark
15k / week BAU to 15k per day peak... maybe averaged 4x higher in Nov/Dec vs other months....
est used seats per month:

160,148,127,129,144,173,156,153,150,190,400,383 = average 192.
monthly = 60k, peak months 250k
cost per conversation is Â£4.50.

600 + 500 = 1100
average monthly conversations 180000, 192 seats

p5 18k decreaser..
get them on stripe - more control
move them to month to month
month to month cadence....
contract for base, and give discount on overage...
negotiate a contracted amount happy with, and on overages give them a way to do it too -
    willing to go off piste, shape it like we want....
    don't commit that we'll have a committed spend implementation done..

    paying annually - contract them for NET out average 150 seats.. kill overage subscription.... no tracking / paying overages...

    100% pay as use...

    could cancel overages on seats if they commit to Fin... we'll be a design partner...



average to agent months saved...
